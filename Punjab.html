  <h1>Capital-Chandigarh</h1>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <img src="https://st.adda247.com/https://wpassets.adda247.com/wp-content/uploads/multisite/sites/5/2023/11/05142234/Capital-of-Punjab.png" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>With the partition of India in 1947, the old British province of Punjab was divided into two parts. The larger western part, including the Punjabi capital of Lahore, went to Pakistan. The eastern part was granted to India, but it was without an administrative, commercial, or cultural centre. Consequently, plans to find a suitable site for the capital of the new Indian Punjab were undertaken soon after partition. The Indian government considered several options—including Amritsar, Jalandhar (Jullundur), Phillaur, Ludhiana, Shimla (Simla), Ambala, and Karnal—and selected the present site of Chandigarh in 1948. It was hoped that a magnificent new state capital, scenically located at the foot of the Himalayas, would become a symbol of modernity, would heal the wounded pride of Indian Punjabis, and would house thousands of mostly Hindu and Sikh refugees who had fled from Muslim-dominated Pakistan.
    The city was planned by the Swiss-born architect Le Corbusier, assisted by Maxwell Fry, Jane Drew, and several Indian architects and town planners. Construction began in the early 1950s, and most of the city was completed in the early 1960s. The project ultimately required the relocation of some 21,000 people from 58 villages.
    The Chandigarh union territory was constituted on November 1, 1966, when the Indian Punjab was reorganized along linguistic lines into two new states—predominantly Hindi-speaking Haryana and Punjabi-speaking Punjab. Straddled between Haryana and Punjab, the city of Chandigarh was made the shared capital of the two states and of the union territory itself. Under the terms of the 1986 Punjab Accord, the entire union territory was to become part of Punjab, whereas the agriculturally productive, mostly Hindi-speaking areas of Fazilka and Abohar, both in Punjab, were to be transferred to Haryana; by the early 21st century, however, this plan had yet to come to fruition.</p>

      <h1>Famous Food</h1>
  <h2>1. Butter Chicken - The King of all Punjabi dishes!
  </h2>
  <img src="https://www.holidify.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/316269329_c4098aa64f_o.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>While chicken may very well be called the national bird of Punjab, butter chicken is the crowning jewel of the food of Punjab. While it may not have originated in Punjab, it was invented by a Punjabi family so that counts, right? No celebration can be complete without this delicacy. This creamy, gravy dish is lightly spiced and paired up with either naan or rumaali roti.</p> 
  <h2>2. Shakkar Para - A sweet, indulgent dish of Punjab!
  </h2>
  <img src="https://www.holidify.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8163600222_794fd5164a_o.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>A great accompaniment to tea, it can also be snacked on when you're craving something a little sweet. Made from semolina and flour, it is light and not overly sweet. For those with a sweeter tooth, these can be coated in coarse sugar or desecrated coconut for a different flavour. These can be just as easily made at home and stored for 2-3 weeks to keep munching on! It is deep-fried Punjabi Food so do be careful of how many you munch on.</p>
