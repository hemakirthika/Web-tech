  <p>Chennai, formerly known as Madras, is the capital of the state of Tamil Nadu and is India's fifth largest city.[1] It is located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. With an estimated population of 8.9 million (2014), the 383-year-old city is the 31st largest metropolitan area in the world.
    Chennai boasts a long history from the English East India Company, through the British rule to its evolution in the late 20th century as a services and manufacturing hub for India. Additionally, the pre-city area of Chennai has a long history within the records of South Indian Empires.</p>
  <h1>Emblem</h1>
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/TamilNadu_Logo.svg/180px-TamilNadu_Logo.svg.png" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>The state emblem was designed in 1949 by artist R. Krishna Rao who was a native of Madurai.Krishna Rao was honoured with awards and titles for his contribution to the state.A student of the Government College of Fine Arts and Crafts in Chennai, who went on to become the principal of the college later, Rao was approached to design the emblem in 1948 when he was a professor of applied arts in the college.
   It consists of the Lion Capital of Ashoka without the bell lotus foundation and flanked on either side by an Indian flag. Behind the capital, is the image of a Gopuram or Hindu temple tower based on the Srivilliputhur Andal temple . Around the rim of the seal runs an inscription in Tamil script, one at the top தமிழ் நாடு அரசு ("Tamil Nadu Arasu" which translates to "Government of Tamil Nadu") and the other at the bottom வாய்மையே வெல்லும் ("Vaymaiye Vellum" which translates to "Truth Alone Triumphs" also commonly known as "Satyameva Jayate" in Sanskrit). It is the only state emblem that has the Indian Flag and Hindu temple tower on its seal.</p>

      <h1>Famous Food</h1>
  <h2>1.Uttappam
  </h2>
  <img src="https://www.holidify.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Mini_Uttappam.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>Uttapam is a dish very similar to the dosa and is a speciality of Tamil Nadu food. It is made by grinding the Urad Dal and rice powder together. It is then allowed to ferment for a few hours and then slow fried over very minimal oil over a skillet. Uttapam is flat and crispy at the sides just like dosa but soft and doughy in the middle like an Idli. The uttapam is then given a little topping of tomatoes, onions, capsicum etc. It tastes delicious with either coconut chutney or Sambar, however, I would recommend the coconut chutney. You can also try it with the spicy tomato and chilli chutney which tastes quite heavenly.</p> 
  <h2>2.Rasam
  </h2>
  <img src="https://www.holidify.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/GarlicRasam.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>Rasam is my personal favourite! Tamarind forms the base of this soup-like dish, and added to it are tomatoes, pepper and cumin seed. The rasam is almost a pre-meal appetizer, which is light and doesn't fill you up too much before a meal. The rasam is a famous dish that is poured over the rice like a normal curry. Though it is almost colourless, it has a burst of flavour. You can also drink it as you would a soup. It is good for a sore throat too.</p>
