  <h1>Capital-Mumbai</h1>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <img src="mc.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>Indigenous tribals have inhabited Mumbai (Bombay) since the Stone Age. The Kolis and Aagri (a Marathi-Konkani people)were the earliest known settlers of the islands. Between the 2nd century BCE and 10th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: the Satavahanas, Abhiras, Vakatakas, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Silharas & Chollas.
    Bhima of Mahikavati established a small kingdom in the area during the late 13th century, and brought settlers. The Delhi Sultanate captured the islands in 1348, and they were later passed to the Sultanate of Guzerat from 1391. The Treaty of Bassein (1534) between the Portuguese viceroy Nuno da Cunha and Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, placed the islands into Portuguese possession in 1534.
    The islands suffered the Maratha Invasion of Goa and Bombay, and the Mughal invasions of Konkan (1685) towards the end of 17th century.[citation needed] During the English East India Company's rule in mid-18th century, it emerged as an important port city, having maritime trade contacts with Mecca, Basra etc.[citation needed] Economic development characterised British Bombay in the 19th century, the first-ever Indian railway line commenced operations between Bombay harbour and Taana city in 1853. Since the early 1900s, the city has also the home base of the Bollywood film industry. The city became a strong base for the Indian independence movement during the early 20th century, it was the centre of the Rowlatt Satyagraha of 1919 and Royal Indian Navy Mutiny of 1946.After India's independence in 1947, the territory of Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into Bombay State.
    In 1960, following protests from the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, the city was incorporated into the newly created Maharashtra state from Bombay state. The Bombay metro area faced some unfortunate events like the inter-communal riots of 1992–93, while the 1993 Mumbai bombings caused extensive loss of life and property. Bombay was renamed Mumbai on 6 March 1996.</p>
  <h1>Emblem</h1>
  <img src="me.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>The first emblem of Jharkhand was adopted on 15 November 2000 when Jharkhand state was formed from the southern part of Bihar. This emblem consisted of an Ashoka Chakra, as depicted on the national Flag of India, surrounded by four letters Js stylised as daggers. The legend underneath, Jharkhand Sarkar, translates as Government of Jharkhand.
    In January 2020, the new Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Hemant Soren announced that a new state emblem is to be adopted soon.He stated that the new emblem should represent the culture, tradition, history ,and future of the state and invited entries for a new design via a public competition.A purported winning design, depicting a tree, was subsequently reported by several media outlets but this was later revealed to be a hoax.
    On 22 July a new emblem was officially approved to be used from 15 August 2020</p>

      <h1>Famous Food</h1>
  <h2>1.Pav Bhaji</h2>
  <img src="mf1.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>Amchi Maharashtra food is incomplete without this dish which has come to be synonymous to the state! Fresh and thick slices of bread, smothered in butter served with a delicious mix of moderately spiced vegetables. This lip-smacking dish has won the heart of every Indian!
  </p>
  <h2>2.Vada Pav</h2>
  <img src="mf2.jpg" class="thumbnail" alt="Dhuska" width="304" height="236">
  <p>Vada Pav can easily be called the Indian version of a burger! A delicious, spicy, deep-fried patty made of potato is squeezed between a thick slice of bread, similar to a burger bun. Between the vada (patty) and pav (bread) a spicy mix of spices and salt is sprinkled and garnished with a fried, salted green chilli. Sounds perfect, isn't it? It's an all-day snack and is extremely popular among Maharashtrians. It is very economical, filling and easily accessible. Another popular offshoot is the Bhajiya Pav, which has batter-fried onions instead of the patty.</p>
